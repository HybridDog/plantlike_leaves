[Mod] plantlike_leaves [plantlike_leaves]

This mod changes the look of default trees.  
Add plantlike_leaves = true to minetest.conf to make it work  
and plantlike_leaves_rotated = true to make plantlike leaves become rotated randomly, which looks great but doesn't work correctly together with leafdecay.  
Or simply have a look at mods section in the settings tab.
